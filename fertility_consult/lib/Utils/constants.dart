    Age Limit: Sperm donors typically need to be between the ages of 21 and 45 years old. However, some clinics might have variations in this age range.

    Health Criteria: Donors must pass thorough medical and health screenings to ensure they are free from infectious diseases, genetic disorders, and other medical conditions that could be passed on to the recipient or offspring.

    Screening Tests: Donors undergo various tests, including blood tests, genetic screening, and tests for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) to ensure their sperm is healthy and safe for use in assisted reproductive procedures.

    Limit on Donations: There might be a limit on the number of times a donor can donate sperm, typically around 10-15 offspring from a single donor in order to limit the chances of inadvertent consanguinity.

    Legal Aspects: Legal agreements and consents may be required from both the donor and the recipient, outlining the rights, responsibilities, and anonymity clauses.
